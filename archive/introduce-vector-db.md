## Why is Vector Search Important in Search Systems?

- **Improvement of Similarity Search**
  - Transform various types of data into high-dimensional vectors for processing
  - Significantly enhances the accuracy and relevance of search results.
- **Providing Personalized and Customized Experiences**
- **Handling Various Data Types**
- **Efficient Information Retrieval**
  - Quickly find similar items within a dataset

## Why is Similarity Search Important?

- Users can find images similar to a specific image in image searches.
- Users can find documents contextually similar in text searches.
- This plays an important role connected to user experience.
  - For example, when delivering chocolates on Valentine's Day, regardless of the chocolate brand, purchasing heart-shaped chocolates.
- Also, a personalized recommendation system can be implemented alongside.

## What is a Vector?

- A vector is used to represent a point in space and can have multiple dimensions.
- Data such as text, images, and videos can be transformed into high-dimensional vectors for understanding.
- The transformation process typically uses machine learning algorithms like deep learning models.

## What is VectorDB?

- A database that stores, manages, and searches high-dimensional vectors.
- VectorDB is optimized for similarity search.

## The Necessity of VectorDB

- Special technology is needed to perform similarity search in real-time within large datasets.
- Traditional database systems are not optimized for this type of search.

## How Does VectorDB Work and Its Key Features?

- **Vector Indexing**
  - Special indexing techniques are used to effectively store and search high-dimensional vector data.
  - Approximate Nearest Neighbor (ANN) algorithm.
- **Similarity Search**
  - When users provide a query vector, the Vector DB quickly finds the vectors most similar to this query stored in the database.
  - This process can be carried out by the ANN search algorithm and can find similar items very quickly even in large datasets.
- **Data Partitioning and Distribution**
  - To effectively manage large vector datasets, Vector DB can partition and distribute data across multiple nodes.
- **Intuitive API Provided**
  - Most Vector DBs provide an intuitive API that allows users to easily insert, query, and modify data.
  - Developers can use this API to easily implement interactions between applications and Vector DB.

### **Vector Data Processing Steps**

1. **Data Preparation**: Original data (text, images, etc.) is converted into vector form. This process is typically performed using a machine learning model.
2. **Data Insertion**: The transformed vectors are inserted into Vector DB. At this time, indexing algorithms are used to efficiently store the data.
3. **Executing Similarity Search**: When users submit a query, Vector DB finds and returns vectors similar to the query from the database.
4. **Evaluation and Adjustment of Results**: Based on the search results, if necessary, indexing methods or query processing techniques can be adjusted to improve search quality.
